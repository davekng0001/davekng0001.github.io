                <p class="about-text">

                    Upon graduating high school I decided to focus on building my technical
                    skills and pursued an electrical engineering degree from Morgan State University.

                <p class="about-text">
                    After recieving my degree I began working in the field doing web development. In one role I created 
                    the front end of an internal team's operational site. The front end tech used was Angular, HTML, CSS, and Typescript.
                    Another role I helped a team with their security and modernization efforts by transcribing 
                    their backend Fortran code to the C language.

                <p class="about-text">
                    Currently I am taking time to work with other buisnesses and people to assist 
                    with their web development needs. 
            
                    Feel free to reach out if you are interested working together.
